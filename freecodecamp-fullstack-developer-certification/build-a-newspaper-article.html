        <p class="author">By Marvin B. Crust, Food Enthusiast Extraordinaire</p>
        <p class="text">In an astonishing turn of events, the world's largest pizza was successfully delivered in the sleepy town of Sliceville yesterday afternoon. The pizza, a mind-boggling 200 feet in diameter, was ordered by the local museum as part of their "Cheese the Day" festival. While the delivery was hailed as a triumph in culinary history, things took a chaotic twist when the pizza’s sheer size caused the delivery van to get stuck under an overpass.</p>
        <p class="text">"I’ve delivered pizzas in every weather condition, but this... this was like driving a pizza through a thunderstorm of cheese and toppings," said Greg “The Crust King” Waters, the driver, who had to make 12 trips back and forth to assemble the behemoth at the town square. Despite the logistical nightmares, the pizza was finally delivered—and it’s unclear whether the delivery driver received a tip or a lifetime supply of mozzarella.</p>
